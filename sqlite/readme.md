## 1. Initialize the db connection

At this point we have a web server running. Now, we need a local database to store information to be consumed by the REST API. In this case, we use a SQLite local database, using the sqlite3 node package.

In a new file database.js we will create the main database connection, and the database initialization.

## 2. Get a list of users

## 3. Get a single user by id

## 4. Create a user

Do not forget to use body parser to get the information from the request
